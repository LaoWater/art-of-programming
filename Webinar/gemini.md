# Project Overview

This project contains two Python scripts, each demonstrating a different aspect of Python programming with a focus on creating graphical user interfaces using PyQt.

- **`suma.py`**: A simple calculator application.
- **`xo_game.py`**: A Tic-Tac-Toe game.

## File Descriptions

### `suma.py`

**Purpose:** This script implements a basic calculator with a user-friendly interface built using PyQt. It can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

**Key Features:**

- **GUI:** Provides a graphical user interface for easy interaction.
- **Basic Operations:** Supports the four fundamental arithmetic operations.
- **Real-time Updates:** Displays the result of the calculation as the user inputs numbers and selects operations.

### `xo_game.py`

**Purpose:** This script is a Tic-Tac-Toe game against a simple computer opponent, created with PyQt. It's designed to showcase basic game logic and UI design in Python.

**Key Features:**

- **Interactive Gameplay:** A classic 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe grid where the player ('X') competes against the computer ('O').
- **Simple AI:** The computer opponent follows a basic algorithm: it first checks if it can win, then checks if it needs to block the player from winning, and otherwise makes a random move.
- **Clear UI:** The interface is designed to be clean, responsive, and intuitive, with a button to start a new game at any time.
