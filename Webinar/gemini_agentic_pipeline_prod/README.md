It appears we hit a un-crossable birdge with OpenAI integration in CloudRun - it seems to not work without calling the OpenAPI key from cloud run instance without special VPC connector - 
Which involves huge cost in terms of the start-up.
- Still, very low chance for it to be related to timeout issue on waiting OpenAI or other connection things?
- Let's see what happens inside the google ecosystem


- It works inside woogle, yet Models seem to under-perform and even not follow instructions properly - at least in first tries.


--------------


For now its now - let's ponder further based on feedback about Models behavior - and consider also adding OpenAI Pipeline - maybe even have them both live -
AND custom used for user&company sentiment - 
As to some people truly prefer Google-Feeling, more enclosed, structured, not too much biased towards freedom, exploring, risking.
While OpenAI on the other hand, it lies closer to the Lands of Freedom, Exploring, Creating.
It is a most deep and very fine distinction between them.

So even if i prefer OpenAI's approach in this type of project (Creating Content) - that is strictly towards my companies beliefs, ~Feeling being closer to OpenAI than Google,
Yet for many other people and bussiness, the googly-feeling is better suited.
This lies further than my own bubble and for a truly 'bending' Agent - in symbiosis with the client - 
This should be the first Decision of the Main Architect Agent -  choosing the right Ecosystem from where the question shall be answered from.

So - let the 25 hours spent in debugging and moving around APIs inside Cloud Run - become the Dual-System Architecture -
Having Both API connected & Serving.
